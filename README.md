# SGD-Regressor-for-Multivariate-Linear-Regression

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the price of the house and number of occupants in the house with SGD regressor.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.Input & Dataset Preparation
Collect the dataset containing house features (area in sq.ft and number of rooms) as input X, and define two target variables: house price and number of occupants.

2.Data Splitting & Feature Scaling
Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split, then standardize the input features using StandardScaler to improve SGD convergence.

3.Model Training using SGD Regressor
Train two separate SGDRegressor models—one for predicting house price and another for predicting occupants—using the scaled training data.

4.Prediction & Evaluation
Predict house price and occupants for test data and new inputs, and evaluate model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
